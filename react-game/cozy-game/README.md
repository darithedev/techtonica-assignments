# Capture The Chicks React Game 🐣

This repository contains a multi-level game (2 levels at this time). Players select a character and collect the randomly spawned chicks to earn points. This game includes two levels. Level 2 introduces a crocodile enemy intended to reduce the player's health upon collision (collision logic for the enemy sprites are not fully implemented yet.)

**Play it now:** [Capture The Chicks React Game](capturethechicks.vercel.app)
